NATO PHONETIC ALPHABET:
The NATO phonetic alphabet is a standardized set of words used to represent letters and numbers in order to ensure clear and accurate communication, particularly in situations where clarity and precision are crucial. It is widely used in military, aviation, maritime, and other professional communication systems, as well as in various civilian applications.
The NATO phonetic alphabet assigns unique words to each letter and number to avoid confusion caused by similar-sounding or easily misinterpreted characters. The words are chosen based on their distinct pronunciation and clarity, making them easier to understand, especially when transmitted over radio or telephone channels with potential noise or distortion.

THE CODE
This code is a program that translates letters and numbers into their corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet equivalents. 
The NATO phonetic alphabet is a standard set of words used to represent each letter and number to ensure clear communication in situations like radio transmissions.

The program allows the user to either provide the input as command-line arguments or enter it interactively. 
Once the input is obtained, each character is looked up in a dictionary that maps it to its NATO phonetic alphabet representation. 
The program then prints each character along with its corresponding NATO translation.

For example, if the input is "hello123", the program will output: <br>
h Hotel   |  **** <br>
e Echo    |  * <br>
l Lima    |  *-** <br>
l Lima    |  *-** <br>
o Oscar   |  --- <br>
1 One (Pronounce as Wun)    |  *---- <br> 
2 Two (Pronounce as Too)    |  **--- <br>
3 Three (Pronounce as Tree) |  ***-- <br>

In simple terms, this program helps you convert letters and numbers into words from a special alphabet used by NATO to avoid confusion during communication. You can provide the input when running the program or enter it when prompted, and the program will display the corresponding NATO translations for each character.
